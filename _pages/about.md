Hi there! I am an Assistant Professor in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.wm.edu/as/computerscience/?svr=web){:target="_blank"} at the [College of William and Mary](https://www.wm.edu/){:target="_blank"}. 

I obtained my Ph.D. in Software Engineering (SE) from [The University of Texas at Dallas](http://www.utdallas.edu/){:target="_blank"} in 2019, under the advice of Dr. [Andrian Marcus](http://www.utdallas.edu/~amarcus/){:target="_blank"}, and my B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in Systems Engineering and Computing from [Universidad Nacional de Colombia](https://bogota.unal.edu.co/){:target="_blank"} in Bogot&aacute;, Colombia.


My broad **research interests** are in software maintenance and evolution, program comprehension, code refactoring, code quality, code documentation, developer's productivity, and text analysis applied to software engineering.

While my research spans multiple SE topics, my **current research focus** is on:
1. automating bug reporting, triage, and resolution (*aka* automate bug report management)
2. recovering and managing the knowledge produced by stakeholders in multiple software artifacts to improve software quality and code change tasks (e.g., code refactoring).

My research often utilizes **empirical methods**, analyzes/leverages **content from different software artifacts** (software bug reports, source code, online discussions, etc.), and builds on **creating, adapting, and integrating techniques** based on program analysis, software repository mining (MSR), information retrieval (IR), natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), and machine learning (ML).

Take a look at my [publications](publications/) to know more about my research.

***IMPORTANT ADS:*** 

**I am looking for motivated and skilled students (undergraduate and graduate) interested in software engineering (SE) research!**

**If you are not a student at W&M, consider applying to the [CS graduate program](https://www.wm.edu/as/computerscience/graduate/admission/index.php){:target="_blank"} (Fall deadline: March 1st/15th, Spring deadline: Oct. 1st).**

**Feel free to email me explaining your interest in my research & SE and attaching your CV.**
